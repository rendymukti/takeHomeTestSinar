i am using java 8 and use maven as a build automation tools

on every package you can see the solution of every question.


Here you can see how to use the program. You need to input the correct mode, which can be either 1 or 2, and the program will proceed based on your input.

After you enter the correct mode, you should input an integer representing time in seconds.

After the program provides the correct output, it will prompt you again to enter the correct mode. It will continue looping until you force stop the program or input -1 for safety reasons.

Feel free to contact me if encountered any issue. Enjoy your day!
